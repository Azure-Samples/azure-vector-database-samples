10,"How long can feasibility studies can last?","Feasibility studies can last between 4-16 weeks, depending on specific problem details, volume of data, state of the data etc. Starting with a 4-week milestone might be useful, during which it can be determined how much more time, if any, is required for completion.",ml-feasibility-study.md
11,"Will a model perform different in production than during training?","Once deployed into production, the model might be performing much worse than expected. This poor performance could be a result of:

The data to be scored in production is significantly different from the train and test datasets
The feature engineering steps are different or inconsistent in production compared to the training process
The performance measure is not consistent (for example your test set covers several months of data where the performance metric for production has been calculated for one month of data)",ml-model-checklist.md
12,"What type of engagement can benefit from a feasibility study?","Every engagement can benefit from a feasibility study early in the project.",ml-feasibility-study.md
13,"Should we concider ethical concerns?","Every ML project goes through the Responsible AI process to ensure that it upholds Microsoft's 6 Responsible AI principles.",ml-model-checklist.md
14,"Who collaborates on feasibility studies?","Collaboration from individuals with diverse skill sets is desired at this stage, including data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, PMs, human experience researchers, and domain experts. It embraces the use of engineering fundamentals, with some flexibility. For example, not all experimentation requires full test coverage and code review. Experimentation is typically not part of a CI/CD pipeline. Artifacts may live in the main branch as a folder excluded from the CI/CD pipeline, or as a separate experimental branch, depending on customer/team preferences.",ml-feasibility-study.md
15,"What results should model monitoring lead to?","Ability to identify changes in model performance
Warnings when anomalies in model output are occurring
Retraining decisions and adaptation strategy",ml-model-checklist.md
16,"If the feasibility study results in enough evidence to support the hypothesis that this problem can be solved using ML, what should be done?",Provide recommendations and technical assets for moving to the operationalization phase,ml-feasibility-study.md
17,"Can ground truth be obtained in forecasting problems?","Forecasting scenarios are an example of machine learning problems where the ground truth could be obtained in most cases even though a delay might occur. For example, for a model predicting the sales of ice cream in a local shop, the ground truth will be obtained as the sales are happening, but it might appear in the system at a later time than as the model prediction.",ml-model-checklist.md
18,"If there is not enough evidence to support the hypothesis at the end of a feasibility study, what should be done?","We detail the gaps and challenges that prevented us from reaching a positive outcome
We may scope down the project, if applicable
We may look at re-scoping the problem taking into account the findings of the feasibility study
We assess the possibility to collect more data or improve data quality",ml-feasibility-study.md
19,"Can ground truth be obtained in recommender systems?","For recommender system, obtaining the ground truth is a complex problem in most cases as there is no way of identifying the ideal recommendation. For a retail website for example, click/not click, buy/not buy or other user interaction with recommendation can be used as ground truth proxies.",ml-model-checklist.md
