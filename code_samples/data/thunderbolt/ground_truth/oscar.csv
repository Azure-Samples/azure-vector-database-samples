0,"What is the purpose of the data exploration workshop?","The purpose of the data exploration workshop is to ensure the team can access the data and compute resources that are necessary for the ML feasibility study, ensure that the data provided is of quality and is relevant to the ML solution, make sure that the project team has a good understanding of the data, and make sure that the SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) needed are present for Data Exploration Workshop.",ml-data-exploration.md
1,"What are some considerations before starting a data exploration workshop?","Before starting a data exploration workshop, it's important to confirm that you have access to the necessary resources (including data). Some questions to consider include requirements for an account setup, security requirements around accessing resources, data access details, computation details, preferences on source code repository, backlog management and work planning, and programming language.",ml-data-exploration.md
2,"What are the key objectives of the data exploration workshops?","The key objectives of the exploration workshops include understanding and documenting the features, location, and availability of the data, understanding the quality of the data, understanding what data has been used so far to analyze recent data-driven projects, understanding what additional internal data may provide insights useful for data-driven decision-making for proposed projects, and understanding what are the possible constraints or challenges in accessing or incorporating this data.",ml-data-exploration.md
3,"What are some questions to consider regarding data access?","Some questions to consider regarding data access include whether the data is on-prem or on Azure already, if it's on-prem, can we move the needed data to Azure under the appropriate subscription, who has permission to move the data, and is the data access approved from a legal/compliance perspective.",ml-data-exploration.md
4,"What are some questions to consider regarding computation?","Some questions to consider regarding computation include whether a VPN is needed for the project team to access these computation nodes (Virtual Machines, Databricks clusters, etc) from their work PCs/Macs, any restrictions on accessing the source data system from these computation nodes, and if we want to create some compute resources, who has permissions to do so.",ml-data-exploration.md
5,"What are the goals of model experimentation?","The goals of model experimentation are: 1. Performance: Find the best performing solution. 2. Operationalization: Keep an eye towards production, making sure that operationalization is feasible. 3. Code quality: Maintain code and artifacts quality. 4. Reproducibility: Keep research active by allowing experiment tracking and reproducibility. 5. Collaboration: Foster the collaboration and joint work of multiple people on the team.",ml-experimentation.md
6,"What are the challenges faced during model experimentation?","The challenges faced during model experimentation are: 1. Trial and error process: Difficult to plan and estimate durations and capacity. 2. Quick and dirty: We want to fail fast and get a sense of whatâ€™s working efficiently. 3. Collaboration: How do we form a team-wide trial and error process and effective brainstorming. 4. Code quality: How do we maintain the quality of non-production code during research. 5. Operationalization: Switching between approaches might have a significant impact on operationalization (e.g. GPU/CPU, batch/online, parallel/sequential, runtime environments).",ml-experimentation.md
7,"What are the benefits of using virtual environments in model experimentation?","The benefits of using virtual environments in model experimentation are: 1. Productization: They facilitate the transition from development to production. 2. Collaboration: They ensure consistency across different development environments, making collaboration easier. 3. Reproducibility: They allow for the recreation of the same environment, improving the reproducibility of experiments.",ml-experimentation.md
8,"What are the expected outcomes for setting up a folder structure and source control in model experimentation? ","The expected outcomes for setting up a folder structure and source control in model experimentation are: 1. A defined folder structure for all users to use, pushed to the repository. 2. A .gitignore file determining which folders should be synced with git and which should be kept locally. 3. A decision on how notebooks are stored and versioned (e.g., stripping output from Jupyter notebooks).",ml-experimentation.md
9,"What are the benefits of using experiment tracking in model experimentation?",""The benefits of using experiment tracking in model experimentation are: 1. Model performance: It allows for tracking and comparing the performance of different models. 2. Reproducibility: It ensures full reproducibility by tracking all required details such as dataset names and versions, parameters, code, and environment. 3. Collaboration: It fosters collaboration by ensuring the experiment tracking framework is accessible to all users. 4. Code quality: It helps maintain code quality by documenting the setup on local environments and defining datasets and evaluation in a consistent manner."",ml-experimentation.md
